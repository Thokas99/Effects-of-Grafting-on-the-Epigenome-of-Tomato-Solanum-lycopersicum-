# Effects of Grafting on the Epigenome of Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)
Grafting is an agricultural technique with ancient origin. Nowadays, it is widely used in modern 
agriculture, bringing many documented advantages for farmers and for the plant itself. Examples of 
these advantages are increased harvesting, increased nutrient absorption, tolerance to biotic and 
abiotic stresses. For a long time, the studies concerning grafting have been focused on the stresses.
The results of these studies, together with an increasing economic attention, led grafting to be a 
possible alternative to the use of pesticides. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), part of the family of 
the Solanaceae, the grafting technique is widely used for commercial purposes and plant health. The 
research made on the effect of the grafting in tomato mainly concern the resistance to pathogens, the 
increase of the harvesting, the variations in the nutritional properties, quality and presentation of the 
fruits for commercial purposes. Grafting, as an act of fusion between parts of a plant, represents a 
great source of stress to which the new produced plant must adapt to survive. The necessary
adaptation involves a series of reversible modifications, often heritable, in the gene expression and 
sometimes in the phenotype of the plant, showing a link between the grafting and the modifications 
of the epigenome. Epigenomics aims to study the mechanisms behind the organization of the 
epigenome such as histone modifications and methylation changes of cytosines. In this work the 
attention was focused on this last epigenetic change. The differences in methylation have been 
identified through comparisons between grafted plants produced with five different types of 
rootstocks (I12, I14, I15, O3 and OPT) and one last graft produced with scion and rootstock of the same 
variety and their controls. The relative methylation of the CG, CHG and CHH contexts was evaluated 
in the comparisons between treatments and controls. These are sequences spread through the whole 
genome and their methylation rate regulates gene expression by silencing or activating specific genes 
and metabolic pathways. The analysis was done through the MCSeEd methodology, which utilizes 
endonucleasesthat are sensible to DNA methylation, then using various bioinformatic tools to process
the produced information. The goal of the analysis was to assess the differences in the DNA
methylation between the comparisons and to identify the differentially methylated genes. Their 
identification was performed thanks to the analysis of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) 
and their comparison with the tomato reference genome. In order to understand the extent of the
alteration in the tomato epigenome and their influence on the fruit, it was essential to identify and 
study the differentially methylated genes.
